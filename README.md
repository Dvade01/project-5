This is the ReadME file for Project-5, is its an adaption of the previous project (project-4) but this time it incorporates a display and submit button
that allows you to insert data, submit it, and relay it back and redisplay the previous data that we entered. It essentially stores the data for later use.
In this project, we use Mongodb to help us store the data, and alter our docker to update itself without having to rebuild each time as explained in the lab.
The files that were updated were calc.html, mypymongo.py, flask_brevets.py, and test_mymongo.py.
